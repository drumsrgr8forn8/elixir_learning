### Bob
Bob is the first exercise at [exercism.io](https://exercism.io).

The goal is to write a Teenager module that will emulate a simple conversaton with typical teenage responses. For silence Bob the teenager should respond "Fine. Be that way!" For shouting Bob should respond "Woah, chill out!". If you ask Bob a question he should stoicly say "Sure." If you're forceful with Bob or say anything else not mentioned above he should simply respond with "Whatever."

Use the tests and enjoy.
